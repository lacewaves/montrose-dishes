##Dishes in Montrose 

Montrose Dishes is an open source app that allows users to search for dishes at local restaurants based on ingredient information.

Search returns dishes on cards that include an image, upvotes and dish information and flip to reveal a map with a pin tied to the restaurant's Google Maps place ID and clickable ingredient buttons that return a search query for dishes containing that ingredient.
